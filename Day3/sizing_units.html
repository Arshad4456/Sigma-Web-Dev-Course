    <h1>Sizing Units</h1>
    <p>In CSS, there are several units of measurement that can be used to define sizes. Here are some of the most common ones:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>px (pixels):</strong> A fixed unit that represents a single pixel on the screen.</li>
        <li><strong>em:</strong> A relative unit that is based on the font size of the element. 1em is equal to the current font size.</li>
        <li><strong>rem:</strong> Similar to em, but it is based on the root font size (usually the font size of the html element).</li>
        <li><strong>% (percentage):</strong> A relative unit that is based on the parent element's size. For example, 50% would be half of the parent element's size.</li>
        <li><strong>vh (viewport height):</strong> A relative unit that is based on the height of the viewport. 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height.</li>
        <li><strong>vw (viewport width):</strong> A relative unit that is based on the width of the viewport. 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These units can be used for various CSS properties such as width, height, padding, margin, and font-size.</p>
    <div class="box">
        <p>This is a box with a width of 50% and a height of 50vh.</p>
    </div>
